Claudia Paris is Assistant Professor at the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Trento, Italy. She received the “Laurea” (B.S.), the “Laurea Specialistica” (M.S.) (summa cum laude) degrees in Telecommunication Engineering and the Ph.D. in Information and Communication Technology from the University of Trento, Italy, in 2010, 2012, 2016, respectively. In 2014 she was a visiting PhD student at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), Rochester, New York State, USA, working on the fusion of airborne and terrestrial LiDAR data. In 2016 she was a visiting Post-Doc at the Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon, Portugal, working on the superresolution of multiresolution multispectral remote sensing images. Her main research includes image processing and machine learning with applications to remote sensing image analysis. She conducts research on remote sensing single date and time series image classification, land cover map update and fusion of multisource remote sensing data for the estimation of biophysical parameters. Dr. Paris won the very prestigious Symposium Prize Paper Award (SPPA) at the 2016 and 2017 International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (IGARSS), in Beijing, China, 2016 and Fort Worth, Texas, USA, 2017.
